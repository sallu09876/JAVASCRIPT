Array iteration methods are built-in functions in JavaScript that let you go through (loop over) each element of an array and do something with it, like checking, changing, or collecting values.
ðŸ‘‰ Example: forEach, map, filter, reduce, some, every.

forEach â†’ Runs a function once for every item in the array.

map â†’ Creates a new array by changing each item in the original.

filter â†’ Creates a new array with items that pass a condition.

reduce â†’ Reduces the array to a single value (like sum or product).

some â†’ Checks if at least one item matches a condition (true/false).

every â†’ Checks if all items match a condition (true/false).

find â†’ Returns the first item that matches a condition.

findIndex â†’ Returns the index of the first item that matches.
